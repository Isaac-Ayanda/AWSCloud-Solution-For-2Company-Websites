# AWSCloud-Solution-For-2Company-Websites

I built a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a mtrone company (a fictitious company) that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website for their DevOps team. A reverse proxy technology from NGINX was used for improved security and performance.

I  utilized AWS infrastructure such as EC2 Virtual Machines, Networking, Target Groups, Autoscaling, Managed Databases with RDS, DNS and Internet gateway, NAT gateway, created security groups and more.
